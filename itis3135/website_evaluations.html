      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Clear contrast between background, text, and buttons so important info stands out and is easy to read.</li>
        <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Consistent colors, typography, and button styles across the site, which makes it feel unified and professional.</li>
        <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Content follows a clean layout/grid, so sections line up nicely and feel organized.</li>
        <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related items (menu info, locations/actions) are grouped together, making the site easy to scan quickly.</li>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The page is visually busy and distracting, so it’s harder to tell what’s most important at first glance.</li>
        <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> The overall page feels cluttered and inconsistent because there are many competing elements instead of a repeated, predictable style.</li>
        <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Layout feels scattered; items don&#39;t follow a clean alignment pattern, which makes it look messy.</li>
        <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Too much content is packed together, so unrelated items can feel mixed and harder to read/scan.</li>
      </ul>
